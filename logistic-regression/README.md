# Logistic Regression

**Logistic regression** is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary). Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis. Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.

Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable (target) is categorical.

For example:

- To predict whether an email is spam (1) or (0).
- Whether online transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).
- Whether the tumor is malignant (1) or not (0).

In other words the dependant variable (output) for logistic regression model may be described as:

## Hypothesis

Training set:
