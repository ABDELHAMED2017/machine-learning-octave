# Anomaly Detection Using Gaussian Distribution

## Gaussian (Normal) Distribution

The **normal** (or **Gaussian**) **distribution** is a very common continuous probability distribution. Normal distributions are important in statistics and are often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known. A random variable with a Gaussian distribution is said to be normally distributed and is called a normal deviate.

Let's say:

![x-in-R](./formulas/x-in-R.svg)

If _x_ is normally distributed then it may be displayed as follows.

![mu](./formulas/mu.svg) - mean value,

![sigma-2](./formulas/sigma-2.svg) - variance.
